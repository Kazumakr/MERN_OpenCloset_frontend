## Description

I built this project for three reasons:  
1: I want to see what clothes I have in my closet while shopping.  
2: I want to see what kind of clothes other people have.  
3: I want to see my friends' sizes and what kind of clothes they like (e.g. colors, brands, etc.) when choosing gifts for them.

It would also be useful for community creation and marketing purposes because of its social media features such as follow, comment, and like.

Through this project, I learned the knowledge for creating social media and e-commerce sites, such as follow feature, search and sort functions.

Adding multiple query parameters seemed easy at first glance, but I personally struggled with that. I'm sure there must be a more efficient way to do this, so I'd like to study it and refactor it.
Other difficulties were in retaining logged-in user information using useContext and in closing the modal using useRef.
I'm glad I learned these because I think these are basic knowledges that will help me in future projects.
